# Repository verification

Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh

python3 tests/run_lyrics_center_regression.py
python3 tests/run_metadata_regression.py
python3 tests/run_provider_attribution_regression.py
python3 tests/check_module_boundaries.py --built
```

`shared/src/test` contains the common JUnit checks, including initialization of
every language table. The host-side regressions execute production Java or
production method declarations with synthetic data. They cover renderer movement,
native track identity and late metadata, provider attribution and caches. The
boundary check verifies shared source ownership and confirms that the module's
merged manifest contains no standalone Activity, service, receiver or provider.
It also rejects direct standard WebKit or Spotify module references in shared
Java. When the private WebKit JAR exists, it checks that AndroidX class definitions
are isolated while public Chromium boundary interface names remain intact.
These checks complement physical playback/UI validation.

Reports are written under `build/reports/regressions`; normal Gradle test reports
remain in `shared/build/reports/tests`. No test depends on another workspace checkout,
an installed Spotify APK, credentials, an account, or a connected Android device.

Use JDK 17 or newer via `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH`. Set `ANDROID_HOME` (or
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) to an SDK containing `platforms/android-36.1/android.jar`.
The standard macOS and Linux SDK locations are also recognized. An alternate
installed platform can be selected with `IVLYRICS_TEST_ANDROID_PLATFORM`.
By default each project's debug classes are preferred, with release classes used
when debug classes are unavailable. `IVLYRICS_TEST_VARIANT=release` explicitly
selects release classes for every project. The `--built` manifest check likewise
accepts debug or release APKs; use `--built --variant release` to select release
explicitly. The host tests do not start Gradle themselves.

The JSON dependency is downloaded on first use from Maven Central into
`build/test-dependencies` and verified against a pinned SHA-256 digest. Subsequent
runs use that verified local dependency. The renderer test has no downloaded
dependency. The optional metadata test arguments accept two explicitly supplied
public JSON fixtures; the default run uses only synthetic data.

GitHub Actions runs common tests, lint for all three modules, both debug APK
builds, the standalone QA variant and all host regressions for pull requests and
branch pushes. Debug and QA APKs are uploaded with the test/lint reports.
The existing tag/manual release workflow
continues to sign and publish the standalone app; it does not publish module APKs
or require release secrets for pull-request checks.
